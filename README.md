This project is forked from https://github.com/MotaWord/python-sdk
The original repository is very old and no longer works so I decided to fix it.

# MotaWord
This API SDK was initially generated by APIMATIC BETA v2.0, and then refactored and edited
for better compliance and usability with MotaWord API.

# How To Install:
`pip install motaword`

# How To Get Started:
For comprehensive examples, check `/examples` folder. You only need to enter your API **CLIENT_ID** and **CLIENT_SECRET**
, then you are good to go with API methods.

# Simple example
```python
from motaword_sdk import MotaWordSDK

"""
Authorize using your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET
Here is how to do that https://www.motaword.com/developer
"""
sdk = MotaWordSDK(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, debug=True)

"""
Create a new project
"""
project = sdk.projects.create('en-US', ['fr', 'ru', 'tr'])
project_id = project['id']

"""
Get a list of projects
"""
project_list = sdk.projects.list(project_id)
print(project_list)

"""
Upload a new document

Returns the updated list of documents in the project.
"""
documents = sdk.documents.upload(
    project_id,
    'example_file.txt',
)
print(documents)
```

# How To Receive API Credentials:
Just go to https://www.motaword.com/developer and create a developer account. Once you confirm your email address, you will
be able to create an API client for yourself, or an "App" as we call API clients.

After creating your app, you will be able to see your credentials, log your activity,
track your projects in your client dashboard and enter payment details.
